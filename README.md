# IPL-AUCTION-analysis
Developing auction strategy for new IPL franchise by analyzing past IPL data to create a strong and balanced squad
# team's squad, there are a few factors that the team's management and auction strategy would likely consider:
1. Budget: The team would need to allocate a budget for the auction and decide how much
money to spend on each player.
2. Team needs: The team would need to identify the positions and types of players they need to
fill out their squad and target those players in the auction.
3. Player availability: The team would need to assess the availability of players, including their
current contracts with other teams and their international commitments.
4. Player form: The team would need to consider the recent form and performances of the
players they are targeting.
5. Player value: The team would need to consider the market value of the players they are
interested in and decide how much they are willing to pay for them.

# Bidding on batters
In T20 cricket, it is important for a team to have a balance of different types of batsmen in order
to be successful in big tournaments.
1. Aggressive batsmen: These batsmen play aggressively and look to score runs quickly by
taking risks and hitting shots all around the ground. They are important because they
can provide a fast start to the team's innings and put pressure on the opposition's
bowlers. This can set the tone for the rest of the innings and give the team a good
platform to build on.
2. Anchor batsmen: These batsmen play a more defensive role, looking to hold one end up
and build a solid foundation for the team's innings. They are important because they can
provide stability to the team's innings and allow the other batsmen to play their natural
game. They also play a crucial role in building partnerships and helping the team score
consistently throughout the innings.
3. Finishers: These batsmen come in to bat towards the end of the innings and look to hit
big shots to help the team achieve a challenging total or chase down a target. They are
crucial in the closing stages of the game because they have the ability to score runs
quickly and take the pressure off the other batsmen.
4. Big-hitters: These batsmen have the ability to hit the ball a long way and are capable of
scoring runs quickly. They are valuable in the middle overs of the game because they
have the ability to take the attack to the opposition's bowlers and put pressure on them.
5. Rotators of strike: These batsmen are good at finding gaps in the field and rotating the
strike to keep the scoreboard ticking over. They are important because they can keep
the run rate up and ensure that the team is able to maintain a good scoring rate
throughout the innings. They also play a crucial role in building partnerships and helping
the team score consistently.

# Bidding on Bowlers
After making a list of batsmans we want to bid in the auction now we need to find some good
bowlers as well.
Bowlers are important in an IPL team for several reasons some of them are:
1. Wicket-taking ability: Good bowlers have the ability to take wickets and break
partnerships, which can be crucial in a format where a single player can have a big
impact on the outcome of the game. Taking wickets helps to put pressure on the
opposition and disrupt their batting lineup, making it easier for the team to defend a low
total or chase down a target.
2. Control: Good bowlers are able to maintain a good level of control over their deliveries,
which allows them to keep the scoring rate in check and prevent the opposition from
scoring too many runs. This is important because it gives the team a better chance of
winning the game by limiting the opposition's scoring opportunities.
3. Ability to bowl in different situations: Good bowlers have the ability to bowl effectively in
different situations, whether it be at the start of the innings, in the middle overs, or in the
death overs. This is important because it gives the team flexibility in terms of their
bowling options and allows them to choose the best bowlers for the specific situation.
4. Ability to bowl in different conditions: Good bowlers are also able to adapt to different
conditions and bowl effectively in a range of environments. This is important because the
IPL is played in different venues across the country, each of which has its own unique
pitch and weather conditions. Bowlers who are able to adapt to these conditions are
more valuable to the team

# All-Rounders
After getting the best bowlers and batters you need few all rounders in your team.
In T20 cricket, all-rounders are players who are skilled at both batting and bowling. They are
valuable to a team because they provide flexibility to the lineup and can contribute in multiple
ways.
# Wicketkeeper
Now, after adding all these players, this team is still incomplete because we donâ€™t have any
wicketkeeper. In T20 cricket, the role of the wicketkeeper is slightly different from that in longer
forms of the game. In T20, the emphasis is on scoring runs quickly, so the wicketkeeper is often
expected to contribute to the team's run total with aggressive batting. They may also be called
upon to bowl a few overs of spin or medium pace.
